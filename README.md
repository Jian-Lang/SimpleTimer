# SimpleTimer
This is a Timer which can not only realize recording time,but also have functions that can change its styles on top menu.
The basic principle is to realize multi-threading through handler. At the same time, this project innovatively solves the problem that the scheduled task of timer cannot be cancelled: restart the timer by restarting the project.
By the way, if you click the button on the top of the menu, then you can change different styles as you want to.
